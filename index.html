            <div class="top-para">  Mushrooms come in many shapes and sizes and can be seen littering forest floors, or damp bathrooms. They live off decaying matter of sorts and play a vital role in the recycling of dead matter. Much overlooked, mushrooms are way more than just a tasty topping :D</div>

                <p class="txt one">  Puffball mushrooms like the one pictured above are eally cool. They are edible and get to huge sizes. Furthermore who would have though that there exists an organism that looks like a giant round marshmallow! I think its like something out of 'Charly and the Chocolate Factory'. </p>

                <p class="txt two"> I always thought these kind of mushrooms looked like little cities for tiny people or ants. They look so friendly and soft. Literally looks like something you would find in a forest after long hard day so you can fall asleep on it. I hope they arnt poisoness but fun fact no mushrooms can hurt you purely from touch!</p>

                <p class="txt three"> When people think of mushrooms they normally think of ones like this. They are super brightly coloured with classic white spots. These kind of mushrooms always remind me of that scene from 'Charly and the Chocolate Factory' where one of the entrants put theirs hands in the white section of a large version of this mushroom and eats the soft candy inside. Always seemed so tasty. </p>

                <p class="txt four"> I do not know about you dear reader but as soon as I look at these really cool mushrooms I instantly think 'Plants vs Zombies DOOMSHOOM'. It just goes to show the incredibly deep colors and interesting shapes this organism can take. This specific mushroom is located in the Europe and is called the 'Violet web cap', a very cool name if you ask me. Although edible it has some not very safe mimic, so best to leave it alone for safety. </p>
